%% Question 5

% compare and constrast the various ways of computing the matrix
% exponential by evaluating the methods on the following matrix, A:

A = [[0 0 0 0 0]; [0 -2 -1 1 0]; [0 2 1 -1 0]; [0 0 0 -1 1]; [0 0 0 0 -1]];

% compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of A
[T, Lambda] = eig(A);


scale_square = expmdemo1(A);

% breaks down when norm(A) is large
power_series = expmdemo2(A);

% breaks down when norm(A) is large
eigendecompsition = expmdemo3(A);

% explain results
